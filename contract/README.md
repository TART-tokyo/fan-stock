## Naming convention of Distributor/Campaign

Since each Distributor/Campaign contract can be used for multiple platforms, an abstract name has been adopted.
The naming convention of the contract is as follows: 

- Recipients type: `Wallet`, `Email`, `UserId`, etc.
- Changeable claim target: `CCT` or none
- Distribution type: none(single campaign) or `Continuous`.

### Examples

- `EmailCampaign`: Single campaign for distributing email addresses.
- `UserIdCampaign`: Continuous distribution campaign for user IDs.
