# Iroiro

## Overview

Iroiro is a management system for Social Tokens.

We think of Social Token as a way to visualize the relationship between the issuer and the holder of the token. And we define it as a kind of communication tool.

We are working on developing protocols that can leverage Social Token with the goal of expanding new possibilities for creators. We use the Ethereum blockchain to provide new options for creators to continue their sustainable creative work.
